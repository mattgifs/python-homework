## Mod 20 Challenge

* [Mod20Challenge](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/tree/main/Mod20Challenge)
  * [Completed Contract Code (joint_savings.sol)](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod20Challenge/joint_savings.sol)
  * [Execution Results](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/tree/main/Mod20Challenge/Execution_Results)
    * I only have 7 screencaps (versus the required 8), but I believe I captured everything I was supposed to while interacting with the contract.
