# Composer Technologies Inc. - Customizable Systematic Investing for Everyday Investors

## Overview and Origin

* Company Name: Composer Technologies Inc

* Founded April 2020, Product offially launched November 2021 

### Founders:
* Benjamin Rollert - BA in Economics (McGill University) 
* Ananda Aisola - BA in Economics (McGill University), Software Engineering Bootcamp (Brainstation), MBA (University of Toronto)

### Idea and Purpose
* Composer, the company's primary product, allows users to manange their own investments by creating Symphonies: rules-based investing approaches similar to those used by large asset managers and investment firms.  

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
* Ostensibly, Composer Technologies has been funded entirely by venture capital firms, including Left Lane Capital, Draft Ventures, First Round Capital, Alumni Ventures, Golden Ventures, and Not Boring Capital. According to Crunchbase, the company is still in its Seed round. As of September 2022, Composer has received $11.4MM in funding from these participants.  

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
When a consumer works with a traditional investment advisor or even one of the newer robo-advisors, they typically complete the equivalent of a questionnaire with questions relating to their time horizon, their appetite for risk, and if they would prefer to avoid investing in particular sectors (i.e. no Oil & Gas, no vices, high ESG scores, etc). After setting these relatively small number of parameters for the advisor, the investor generally has very little control over how his or her money is managed going forward. 

Composer offers a more comprehensive solution for longer-term traders and investors who want more involvement and customization. After opening a brokerage account, the user can choose a prebuilt strategy or create their own - Composer has dubbed these "Symphonies." Creating a Symphony is a process that basically involves writing pseudocode for desired triggers, actions, and security names (the entire US Stock universe) by dragging and dropping blocks on a grid. Further, the platform allows for optimization by way of backtesting and comparison to benchmarks, so the user can iterate through ideas to find the one best-suited to him or her. 

### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?

As stated above, Composer is intended for longer-term traders and investors who want more involvement and customization in how their investments are managed. These are people who are likely knowledgeable about investing and financial markets, and as such, will be less likely to settle for the offerings of traditional advisors and robo-advisors. The size of this particular market is difficult to estimate, and probably pretty niche. It is most likely a small but nonzero chunk of the 100+ million retail investors in the United States.

The biggest aspect of the value proposition that sets Composer apart from competitors is that it provides a simple graphical user interface that allows retail investors to define and refine their own custom strategies without having to know how to code a program of their own. 

### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
According to the company blog, both the frontend and backend of the Composer product are built on Clojure - a seemingly uncommon language that can trace its lineage back to Java. Being that this is a relatively new and uncovered company, I was unable to find any additional information regarding technology employed there.


## Landscape:

### What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Composer Technologies is at the intersection of a few FinTech domains, including Wealth and Investment Management, Robo-Advising, and - to some extent - Cryptocurrency (they allow crypto investment, but do not act as a proper wallet). 

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Inarguably, the adoption of robo-advisors has been the largest trend over the last decade, and the growth of the domain is expected to continue by more than 27% annually through the end of the 2020s (Grand View Research, 2022). After rising to prominence with early platforms like Wealthfront and Betterment, nearly all major brokerages and client-facing investment managers offer some version of such a tool. Robo-advisors are typically lower-cost than traditional money managers, and they offer greater transparency; both factors have helped make them popular, especially with younger cohorts.   

### What are the other major companies in this domain?
Wealthfront, Betterment, Interactive Brokers, Schwab, Wells Fargo, ETrade

## Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Admittedly, very little. It does not seem like the product has reached any sort of broad adoption, nor has it gotten very much press. These is either because the market is *too* niche (fatal), or their reliance on word-of-mouth advertising is simply not enough to move the needle (fixable).   

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Per their website, over 1 million backtests have been run on the Composer platform. Additionally, more than 250,000 orders have been executed, and Composer has facilitated more than $200MM in trading volume since product launch.

There is not a firm to which we can compare the backtest metric (perhaps TradingView, but that number would be nearly impossible to measure). 

With regard to orders and trading volume, it's difficult to compare apples to apples. For example, Interactive Brokers facilitates nearly 2 million trades **per day**, however that includes all of their trades (not only trades from automated strategies). This is also simply the number of trades, not the notional dollar value of all of those trades. 

Wealthfront would be a better comparison, however, similar metrics to those touted by Composer could not be found. That said, Wealthfront has over 443,000 users and $23BB in AUM as of 2022.

Based on these loose comparisons, it seems fair to say that Composer is barely a drop in the bucket at this time. 


## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
It's not as much a new product or service as it is an augmentation to the product they already offer: the implementation of artificial intelligence. 

### Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
A few reasons:
- **It would further simplify the creation of custom Symphonies**. Instead of dragging and dropping blocks of code, assigning weights, and selecting securities, the user could simply craft a prompt in text, and AI could generate the blueprint for the strategy. I believe this would take the user from zero to one much faster. A better first experience with the platform would also lead to much greater excitement, and likely a higher referral rate. 
- **AI could also be deployed by the firm itself to generate and test its prebuilt Symphonies**. Continuous improvement with these would likely lead to more complex but profitable strategies. At a certain point, Composer could probably get away with charging a small premium to utilize those strategies. Granted, this may be going against Composer's mission (hedge fund returns without hedge fund costs or exclusivity, more or less), but if 1) the strategies are good enough, 2) people are willing to pay, and 3) the cost is negligible compared to those of larger funds - revenue is revenue. 
- **Timing**. Narrow-ish AI is having a moment in 2023, and has proved interesting already, if not downright useful. Its implementation would bring some attention to Composer and ideally would increase active users and AUM pretty quickly.

### What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
The most effective and efficient way to do this would probably be to utilize ChatGPT, which would have to be licensed from OpenAI. Alternatively, Composer Technologies could create their own version of this, but that option is likely untenable for such a small company whose core focus isn't AI in particular.   

### Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
ChatGPT in particular seems like a logical piece of tech to use for at least some of the reasons listed above. It's an impressive leap forward in artificial intelligence, and judging by what I've seen it do, I think it would improve the sort of "extended onboarding experience" for Composer, by making it more fun, interesting, and easier to learn.
