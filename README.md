# python-homework

The purpose of this repository is to house all completed solo homework assignments.

Each assignment can be found at the location(s) specified below:

* [Mod2Challenge](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/tree/main/Mod2Challenge)
  * /PyBank/main.ipynb contains the code to analyze the source data (/PyBank/budget_data.csv)
  * The output of the above analysis is located in /PyBank/analysis/budget_analysis.txt
  * *The optional PyRamen project was not completed.

* Mod4Challenge
  * [final_whale_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod4Challenge/final_whale_analysis.ipynb)

* Mod5Challenge
  * [financial_planner.ipynb](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod5Challenge/Starter_Code/financial-planner.ipynb)

* Mod6Challenge
  * [san_francisco_housing.ipynb](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod6Challenge/san_francisco_housing.ipynb)

* Mod7Challenge
  * [/Starter_Files/README_final.md](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod7Challenge/Starter_Files/README_final.md)
  * Individual file and notebook locations noted in the linked README

* Mod10Challenge
  * [crypto_investments.ipynb](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod10Challenge/crypto_investments.ipynb)

* Mod11Challenge
  * [DONE_forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod11Challenge/Starter_Code/DONE_forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb)

* Mod12Challenge
  * [Analysis](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod12Challenge/Starter_Code/credit_risk_resampling.ipynb)
  * [Report](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod12Challenge/Starter_Code/report-template-complete.md)
 
* Mod13Challenge
  * [Notebook](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod13Challenge/venture_funding_with_deep_learning.ipynb)
  * [Saved Models](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/tree/main/Mod13Challenge/saved_models)
 
* Mod18Challenge
  * [pychain.py](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod18Challenge/pychain.py)
    * In setup for streamlit cache, I changed 'st.cache' to 'st.cache_resource' since the former is being decremented (I got a warning message). Functionality seems to be retained after that change.
  * [Streamlit App Validation Image](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod18Challenge/mod18_validation.png)
    * Multiple blocks added with different difficulty settings. The 'True' print near the bottom of the screen indicates a pass of the validation test.

* Mod19Challenge
  * [ChallengeRepo](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/tree/main/Mod19Challenge)
    * NOTE: In setting up the raw_tx dictionary in crypto_wallet.py, I had to change 'gasPrice' from the default 0. The original value produced an error when running the streamlit app, and the new value was inferred from that error.
  * [Streamlit Validated Transaction](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod19Challenge/ScreenShots/streamlit_kryptojobs_validatedtransactionhash.png)
  * [My Ganache Account Balance(after transaction)](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod19Challenge/ScreenShots/ganache_acct_bal.png)
  * [My Ganache Account Transaction History](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod19Challenge/ScreenShots/ganache_acct_transaction_history.png)
  * [Transaction Details](https://github.com/mattgifs/python-homework/blob/main/Mod19Challenge/ScreenShots/transaction_details.png)
  * The instructions were unclear as to how I could view the account balance of the recipient; I could not find a way to click their address and see the balance. Was I supposed to change the candidates' addresses from what is listed in krypto_jobs.py to the ones listed in my ganache workspace?
